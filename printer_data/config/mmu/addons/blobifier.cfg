# Sample config to be used in conjunction with Blobifier Purge Tray, Bucket & Nozzle 
# Scrubber mod. Created by Dendrowen (dendrowen on Discord). The Macro is based on a 
# version, and Nozzle Scrubber is made by Hernsl (hernsl#8860 on Discord). The device is 
# designed around a Voron V2.4 300mm, but should work for 250mm and 350mm too. This 
# version only supports the assembly on the rear-left of the bed. If you decide to change 
# that, please consider contributing to the project by creating a pull request with the 
# needed changes.

# IMPORTANT: The rear-left part of your bed becomes unusable by this mod because the 
#            toolhead needs to lower down to 0. Be sure not to use the left-rear 130x35mm.

# The goals of this combination of devices is to dispose of purged filament during a 
# multicolored print without the need of a purge block and without the flurries of
# filament poops consuming your entire 3D printer room. The Blobifier achieves that by
# purging onto a retractable tray which causes the filament to turn into a tiny blob 
# rather then a large spiral. This keeps the waste relatively small. The bucket should be
# able to account for up to 200 filament swaps (for the 300mm V2).
